Install gcc, g++, sox

Put the prj folder with a path without 'spaces':
/home/toni/lab/prj --> OK
/home/toni/lab work/prj --> NOT OK

Open a terminal, go to prj, execute make. 

Put the prj folder with a path without 'spaces':
/home/toni/lab/prj --> OK
/home/toni/lab work/prj --> NOT OK

Open a terminal, go to prj, execute make. 
The 'make' program makes things according to the instructions found in the 
'makefile' file.

$ make all

It is better to include your path in the PATH environment:

$ gedit $HOME/.bashrc
PAV=/home/toni/lab/bin/release
export PATH=".:$PAV:$PATH"

$ source $HOME/.bashrc

Foreach program:
1. Create a directory
2. Put in that directory all the .c, .cpp, .h that you want. 
   You can put the .h in the include (specially if you create libraries 
   to be used by other programs)
3. Create the makefile. You can do it using the script, 
   $ make_wizard -p1
   This script creates a makefile than indicates to the 'make' that 
   - all the files in the directory need to be compiled
   - math library and libpav library is included during the link
   - the name of the output program is the name of the directory

5. Compile: 
   $ make debug
or
   $ make release

If you want to compile this dir from the generic dir (prj) open the
makefile (in prj folder) and add the directory.

The executable files are in the folder bin/debug or bin/release



Install SPTK:  Speech Signal Processing Toolkit (SPTK):
In http://sp-tk.sourceforge.net/ you can find documentation and examples for
using this toolkit.

Download, uncompress, configure, install

	  $ wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sp-tk/SPTK-3.6.tar.gz
	  $ tar zxvf SPTK-3.6.tar.gz 
	  $ cd SPTK-3.6
	  $ ./configure --prefix=$PWD/../sptk
	  $ make
	  $ make install 

Add the directory with the SPTK tools (look for it at $PWD/../sptk) 
to the path in your bashrc file:
 
$ gedit $HOME/.bashrc
SPTK=/home/toni/...    <-- add directory/home/toni/lab/bin/release
export PATH=".:$PAV:$SPTK:$PATH"
